# ThunderSharp

## Description
Project for evaluation of Gama Academy C# class.\
It's a system of control of skills and salaries of a TV station.

## Logic of Team Formation
Our logic was randomness based on who responded first in the whatsapp group because on the real-life aspect we won't know who we're going to be with.
Gerson has a strong experience with back-end and a little experience with front-end, also he has never been on a project from zero, as he only acted as support and it's first time working with c# and has experience with PL/SQL.
Nathiel has experience with back-end using c# and android, plus front-end with angular and has a little experience with DB, Scrum and ITIL.
Vitor Has experience with SQL, swift, python and javascript mostly with back-end, also no experience with c#. He worked direct with client for a few months with improviments and support. He worked with 2 projects since start till the end.
Everyone has a good interpersonal realationship and like processes.
We can't say more at this moment because we met a little time ago.

## About Scrum
We're using Dailys to know about our study progress.\
We did planing poker and could be checked on our issues.\
We have our Product Backlog that is features our assignemnt and choose our Sprint Backlog.\
Everyone has doing the job of Prodcut Owner because none is one specialist.\
Vitor is acting like a Scrum Master.

## Greatest Difficulties
* Short deadline.
* Lack of experience with Agile of most of members.
* Lack of previous profissional experience with c#, .net and angular.

## Greatest Learnings
* How to work with people with different skills/stacks.
* How .net and c# could be used.
* Learned more about ITIL, Scrum and Softskills.

## Greatest Development
* Networking
* A good friendship with the team.
* Good colaboration.
* New Skills.

## Project Infrastructure
* We used Solid and DDD as pattern.
* We used lo-fi mockup to help to implement what we will needed.
* We defined a Gitflow where the project has his base branch and each developer has his own branch. 
  When the development had finished each one of them did merge their branches with base branch, making sure that everyone would be working with most recent updates.
