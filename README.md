# ThunderSharp

## Description
Project for evaluation of Gama Academy C# class.\
It's a system of control of skills and salaries of a TV station.

## Logic of Team Formation
Our logic was randomness based on who responded first in the whatsapp group because on the real-life aspect we won't know who we're going to be with.

## About Scrum
We're using Dailys to know about our study and building artifacts like our lo-fi mockup.\
We will do our Planning meeting with Planning poker when done.\
We have our Product Backlog that is features Functional and Non-Functional features of our assignemnt.\
We will choice our Sprint Backlog from Functinal and Non-Functional features basead on time and a try to do Non-Functional when done Functional.
